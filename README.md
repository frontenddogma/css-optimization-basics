# CSS Optimization Basics: An Open Living Book

This is the source of the open and living book [_CSS Optimization Basics_](https://meiert.com/en/blog/css-optimization-basics/) by Oâ€™Reilly author and former Google tech lead [Jens Oliver Meiert](https://meiert.com/en/) (short: Jens).

You have two options to get the book.

1. You can read the book here, for free.
2. For a small amount you can purchase a nicer electronic copy at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TVW1ZT8/?tag=meiert-20), [Apple Books](https://books.apple.com/us/book/css-optimization-basics/id1571260941?ls=1), [Kobo](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/css-optimization-basics), [Google Play Books](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Jens_Oliver_Meiert_CSS_Optimization_Basics?id=xgTfDwAAQBAJ), [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/css-optimization-basics), or [Gumroad](https://j9t.gumroad.com/l/YzeaH)<!-- , or [Payhip](https://payhip.com/b/Bnie) -->.

In the first versions of _CSS Optimization Basics_, there are probably some errors and typos. There will also be more that not only could but _should_ be said about CSS optimization. (The book is a lot about the _craft_ and the _basics_ of writing CSS.)

As this is an indie book, consider these options:

1. [File an issue](https://github.com/frontenddogma/css-optimization-basics/issues/new) for any problems you findâ€”and get mentioned as a book contributor.
2. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/frontenddogma/css-optimization-basics/pulls) for specific fixes and suggestionsâ€”and, if accepted, get mentioned as a book contributor, too.

With increasing quality and maturity of the book, the price of ebook may go up (probably only up to the price of [some of Jensâ€™s self-published books](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/13623828.Jens_Oliver_Meiert)). That still wonâ€™t be much for a tech book, even a short one, however. Everyone can always grab the free version or an update here, too; if you purchase a copy, please keep that in mind as book sellers may have different ways of sharing updates.

This just for a start. The book is open as everythingâ€™s public and free, and itâ€™s living as itâ€™s going to be maintained both by Jens as well as everyone who likes to help make it better.Â ðŸ¥‚
