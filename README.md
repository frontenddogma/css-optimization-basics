# CSS Optimization Basics: An Open Living Book

This is the source of the open and living book [_CSS Optimization Basics_](https://leanpub.com/css-optimization-basics) by O’Reilly author and former Google tech lead [Jens Oliver Meiert](https://meiert.com/en/) (short: Jens).

You have two options to get the book.

1. You can read the book here, for free.
2. For a small amount you can purchase a nicer electronic copy at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TVW1ZT8/?tag=j9t-21-20), [Apple Books](https://books.apple.com/us/book/css-optimization-basics/id1571260941?ls=1), [Kobo](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/css-optimization-basics), [Google Play Books](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Jens_Oliver_Meiert_CSS_Optimization_Basics?id=xgTfDwAAQBAJ), [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/css-optimization-basics), [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/YzeaH).

In the first and initial version of _CSS Optimization Basics_, there are probably a few errors and typos. There will also be more that not only could but _should_ be said about CSS optimization. (The book is a lot about the _craft_ and the _basics_ of writing CSS.)

Because of this early state of things, consider two other options:

1. [File an issue](https://github.com/j9t/css-optimization-basics/issues/new) for every problem you find—and get mentioned as a book contributor.
2. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/j9t/css-optimization-basics/pulls) for specific fixes and suggestions—and, if accepted, get mentioned as a book contributor, too.

With increasing quality and maturity of the book, the price of ebook may go up (probably only up to the price of [some of Jens’s self-published books](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/13623828.Jens_Oliver_Meiert). That still won’t be much for a tech book, even a short one, but the idea is to give those who buy a copy a good deal. Remember that everyone can always grab the free version or an update here, so whoever’s purchasing a copy please keep that in mind as book _updates_ may or may not be available for any editions of the book appearing on sale anywhere outside of Leanpub.

This just for a start. The book is open as everything’s public and free, and it’s living as it’s going to be maintained both by Jens as well as everyone who likes to help make it better. 🥂
