HTML is super-popular. Everyone can write HTML. Or can they? In the spirit that everything can be tweaked and optimized, _Upgrade Your HTML_ is a first light book in a playful series to review and improve real-life examples of HTML.

## [The Little Book of HTML/CSS Coding Guidelines](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-little-book/9781492048459/) (2015)

A proper plan can improve your code, including your HTML documents and CSS style sheets. Jens Oliver Meiert explores the theory and practice of coding guidelines and shows, using Google’s HTML and CSS standards as a particular example, how consistency and care can make the code base you create today much easier to deal with when you—or someone else—work on it later.

_On Web Development_ bundles 134 articles and the last 11 years of technical writings by Jens Oliver Meiert (meiert.com). Freshly reordered and commented, the articles cover processes and maintenance, HTML and CSS, standards, as well as development and design in general; they range from coding basics and principles, to carefully scathing criticism, to tips and tricks and trivia.

## [The Little Book of HTML/CSS Frameworks](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-little-book/9781492048121/) (2015)

With the speed of web development today, it’s little wonder that so many frameworks are available, since they come with a promise of saving development and design time. But using the wrong framework, or wrongly using the right framework, can be costly. This concise book shares higher-level ideas around web development frameworks that govern HTML and CSS code, whether you’re looking at an external option or planning to build your own.

## [100 Things I Learned as an Everyday Adventurer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GAC2SJI/?tag=j9t-21-20) (2013)

This is the book that the most boring person would write when it found a life and had too much time at his hands. Meet Jens, a hectic, neurotic self-proclaimed adventurer, and his very individual account of one hundred different activities he’s tried over the last three years (2010–2013). From crocheting to security guard certifications to rafting, everything had a lesson, and these lessons are shared in this book. Expect the German answer to Winston Wolfe to explain how to live a life, in his own words.
